### About Me
I'm a bit of a programmer. I dream of becoming a real professional. My ideology is democracy. I am engaged in the distribution of free and open source software. I support GNU. My dream is to replace companies like Google, so that instead of endlessly collecting data, they can finally start making really good decisions. I believe that everyone has the right to speak and think without censorship. That's all)
